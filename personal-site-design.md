What is your site's primary purpose?

    The primary purpose is to share my EDA phase-0 experiences through blog posts. By creating these blog posts I will be able to practice/show off the web dev concepts I am learning.

Who is my target audience?

    The two primary audiences are myself, and my fellow phase-0 students.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

    I have had a look through other phase-0 blogs when I have been stuck or looking for inspiration. I would be nice if others want to do the same - have a peek at the code and maybe learn/<del>steal</del>borrow something.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

    I want to build an attractive website with tidy, simple, readable code. Try new things in the process.
